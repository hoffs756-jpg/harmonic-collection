   <h1>Salad. Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach and Quinoa Salad</h1>
   <p class="subtitle">Refreshing and light!</p>
  
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
 	<li>1 cup quinoa, rinsed in a fine-mesh colander</li>
       <li>⅓ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped</li>
       <li>2 cups roughly chopped fresh spinach or arugula</li>
       <li>⅓ cup sliced almonds, ¼ teaspoon olive oil, Salt to taste</li>
       <li>Lemon dressing. 2 tablespoons olive oil. 2 tablespoons lemon juice<li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced. 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard. ½ teaspoon salt. Pinch of red pepper flakes. Freshly ground black pepper, to taste. </li>
   </ul>


  
   <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the quinoa has absorbed all of the water, about 15 minutes, reducing heat as time goes on to maintain a gentle simmer. Remove from heat, cover, and let the quinoa rest for 5 minutes, which gives it time to fluff up.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, to prepare the dressing: Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, salt and red pepper flakes. Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
       <li>To toast the almonds: Warm ¼ teaspoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the almonds and a dash of salt and cook, stirring frequently (beware, these burn quickly!), until they are golden and fragrant. Transfer the toasted almonds to a medium-sized serving bowl to cool.</li>
       <li>Once the quinoa is done cooking, fluff it with a fork and then transfer it into your serving bowl. Drizzle all of the dressing on top and toss to combine. Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and wait a few more minutes to add the spinach so it doesn’t wilt completely. Toss again, season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and serve immediately.</li>
