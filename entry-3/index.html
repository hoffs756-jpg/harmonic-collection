   <h2>FULL COURSE MEAL</h2>
     <p>Entree. Beef Welington</p>
 
 <div
2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin

4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided

2 tablespoons butter

1 onion, chopped

½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms

salt and pepper to taste

1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth

2 tablespoons red winee>
</div>
 <p>

step 1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
step 2. Place beef tenderloin in a baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over beef.
step 3. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool completely.
step 4. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
step 5. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
step 6. Mix paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
step 7.Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center.
step 8.Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.
step 9.Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 122 to 130 degrees F (50 to 54 degrees C) for medium rare. Set aside to rest.
step 10.Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.
