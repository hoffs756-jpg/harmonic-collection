<h1>Moon in the Window</h1>

<p>I wish I could say I was the kind of child
who watched the moon from her window,
would turn toward it and wonder.</p>


  <p>
I never wondered. I read. Dark signs
that crawled toward the edge of the page.
It took me years to grow a heart
from paper and glue.</p>


 <p>All I had was a flashlight, bright as the moon,
a white hole blazing beneath the sheets.</p>
